# E-commerce Website
I have created this project using Django(a python based web framework). It follows MTV pattern which is an extension of MVC pattern.

MTV(Model-Template-View) Pattern
All my model, template & view files are stored inside the store folder.

All the model classes are written in models.py file
Template is the view according to MVC
View is the controller according to MVC.
